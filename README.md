## Project Components:
â€¢	**Dialogflow Integration**: Utilized Dialogflow to build the chatbot's conversational interface, defining intents, entities, and fulfillment logic for natural language interactions.

â€¢	**FastAPI Backend**: Employed FastAPI for the backend logic and API endpoints, facilitating integration with the database and handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently.

â€¢	**MySQL Database**: Used a MySQL database and hosted on Heroku to store and manage order data. The database schema was designed to handle orders, order items, and tracking information.

â€¢	**Deployment on Heroku**: Deployed both the FastAPI backend and MySQL database on Heroku, a cloud platform, to ensure scalability, reliability, and accessibility of the chatbot application.

â€¢	**Bellabite Website Development and Chatbot Integration**: Built the Bellabite website and integrated the chatbot using HTML, allowing users to interact with the chatbot directly from the website for convenient order placement and tracking.

## Project Features:
â€¢	**Order Processing**: Users can place orders for their favourite dishes through the chatbot by specifying food items and quantities. The chatbot validates the order details, allows adding or removing items, stores the updated order in the database. It assigns a status to the order and provides an order ID to the user for tracking and receiving their orders.

â€¢	**Order Tracking**: Once an order is placed, users can track the status of their orders in real-time using order ID through the chatbot. The chatbot retrieves order status information from the database and provides updates to the users accordingly.

â€¢	**Enhanced User Interaction**: The chatbot not only handles order processing and tracking but also provides restaurant timings and engages in small talk. Additionally, it supports voice commands, making the ordering process even more convenient and hands-free for users.


Note: Due to free tier hosting limitations, you might experience occasional server downtime. Under usual circumstances, the chatbot operates smoothly.
